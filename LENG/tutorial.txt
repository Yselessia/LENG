Before using the program, you must add students to the database by clicking EDIT RECORDS => ADD STUDENT 
Adding or editing student records is under EDIT RECORDS too.

The COMMIT button will save your student record to the database. 
When the record has been saved, you can click the LANG home button to return to the previous menu.
The BACK or LANG HOME button will always be in the top left corner, but clicking it won't save any changes you've made. 

You can add exercises by clicking CREATE EXERCISE 
Again, COMMIT will save the exercise, and the ID will be automatically generated.
Note it down if you want to see the exercise later! You'll also be able to find exercises by date.
Add sentences to the exercise to let the program mark any errors. 

If the sentence isn't saved (there should be a pop-up to confirm it) relaunching the program may fix the bug.
Adding multiple words to the dictionary without relaunching may cause random errors.

You'll be able to see your students' progress by clicking VIEW RECORDS and selecting SEE ERRORS or SEE PROGRESS 
You can see the sentences later by selecting the exercise in VIEW EXERCISES

Thanks for using the LANG Language Analysis program tutorial!
